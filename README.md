made this out of scratch out of personal interest (and teaching myself in the process)

## how 2 run ?? D:
Activate lurk mode aka build a database with: **npm lurk** or **node index.js**

### how do i see results
play around with the reader.js file to suit it your needs, right now it should give top 5 from the database file
run it with **npm read** or **node reader.js**
