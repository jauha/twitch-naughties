made this out of scratch out of personal interest (and teaching myself in the process)
#### so what does it do?

this was created due interest to see if toxicity by streamers affect chatters/viewers.

## how 2 run ?? D:
Activate lurk mode aka build a database with:

play around with the reader.js file to suit it your needs, right now it should give top 5 from the database file
run it with 
* npm read
